# This is a template dockerfile meant to be personalized for application development.
# Copy this dockerfile into a new build context (directory) and modify to taste.

# After a new build context is created, build with
# `docker build -f <project-name>-dockerfile -t <user-name>/<project-name> .`

# Run the container to start up a development environment.  Optionally, map host
# directories into the container with -v for development convenience, which is
# especially nice for source code to persist after the container closes.
# The following maps the host directory into the container 'read only'

# 'docker run -it --rm -v [host/directory]:[container/directory]:ro <user-name>/<project-name>'.
# Example: 'docker run -it --rm -v ~/src/my-hcc-project:/root/my-hcc-project:ro kknox/my-hcc-project'.

# ubuntu:14.04.3, the native kernel is '3.19'
