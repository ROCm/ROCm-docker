# Build this dockerfile with `docker build -f rock-deb-dockerfile -t roc/rock .`

# To reduce container rebuild time, place commands least likely to change at top to
# most changing at bottom

# This builds the radeon open compute kernel and kernel modules

# This kfd has only been tested so far on linux-headers-generic-lts-vivid
# ubuntu:14.04.3, the native kernel is '3.19'
